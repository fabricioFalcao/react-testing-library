### TrybeTunes Project

👨‍💻 **What was developed**

In this project, I created TrybeTunes, an application capable of playing music from various artists and bands, creating a list of favorite songs, and editing the profile of the logged-in user. This application is capable of:

- Logging in.
- Searching for a band or an artist.
- Listing the available albums from that band or artist.
- Viewing the songs of a selected album.
- Playing a preview of the songs from the album.
- Favoriting and unfavoriting songs.
- Viewing the list of favorited songs.
- Viewing the profile of the logged-in user.
- Editing the profile of the logged-in user.
